1.Inheritance is a process of extracting some of the properties from an existing class and adding additional features by creating a new class.
2.Existing class: Known as the Superclass, Base class, or Parent class.
3.New class: Known as the Derived class, Subclass, or Child class.
4.Inheritance introduces the concept of reusability, allowing us to use existing properties repeatedly without modifying them.
5.Inheritance uses "extends" keyword to inherit from one class to another.

1.Single Inheritance:-
--------------------
A single subclass inherits from one superclass.

   Superclass
       |
   Subclass


2. Multiple Inheritance:-(Java explicitly disallows multiple inheritance)
-----------------------
A subclass inherits from two or more superclasses.

   Superclass1    Superclass2
         \         /
          \       /
           Subclass



3. Multilevel Inheritance:-
-------------------------
Inheritance that occurs over multiple levels.

   Superclass
       |
   IntermediateClass
       |
   Subclass


4.Hierarchical Inheritance:-
--------------------------
One superclass has multiple subclasses.

       Superclass
         /    \
        /      \
  Subclass1   Subclass2


5. Hybrid Inheritance:-
----------------------
A combination of multiple and hierarchical inheritance.

       Superclass
       /         \
      /           \
Subclass1      IntermediateClass
                     |
                Subclass2
